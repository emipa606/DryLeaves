Reimplements Jecrell's tobacco mod and adds a drying rack building for drying tobacco and smokeleaf leavee before they can be rolled and smoked.

# Features



- New tobacco plant and possibility to craft cigarettes, cigars and chocolate cigars (made by Jecrell)
- Smokeleaf and tobacco leaves need to be dried before they can be rolled.
- New drying rack building for drying the leaves



# Instructions



- You can choose which leaves to dry (tobacco or smokeleaf) using an in-game button when you select the drying rack building
- Leaves get dried faster in hot weather, under the sun sunlight and in a wind. Rain and snow slows and stops the drying process.
