# Jecrell's Tobacco & Dry Leaves #

<img src="https://gitlab.com/rwmods/dry-leaves/raw/master/About/preview.png" width="700">

Reimplements Jecrell's tobacco mod and adds a drying rack building for drying tobacco and smokeleaf leavee before they can be rolled and smoked.

**NOTE** [Universal Fermenter](https://gitlab.com/rwmods/universal-fermenter) is required to run this mod.

# Features #
* New tobacco plant and possibility to craft cigarettes, cigars and chocolate cigars (made by Jecrell)
* Smokeleaf and tobacco leaves need to be dried before they can be rolled. 
* New drying rack building for drying the leaves

# Instructions #
1. Download and install Universal Fermenter (provides C# stuff for this mod)
2. Download and install Dry Leaves (load order does not matter)
3. You can choose which leaves to dry (tobacco or smokeleaf) using an in-game button when you select the drying rack building
4. Leaves get dried faster in hot weather, under the sun sunlight and in a wind. Rain and snow slows and stops the drying process.
